# Tools

-   [`OpenApi TypeScript Code Generator`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openapi-typescript-codegen)

-   [`Chakra-UI`](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started) because it provides headless
    components which are like building blocks and make styling fast and easy. It's
    modular. It makes it easy to work with responsive styles. It provides dark/white
    theme support.

-   [`AsyncSelect` from
    `chakra-react-select`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chakra-react-select) for
    the select component. The only 2 components Chakra-UI is missing are `Select` and
    `DatePicker`. The [`Select` component](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/pull/6241)
    is in progress and will most likely be released soon.

-   [`Redux Toolkit`](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
    because it's focused on data fetching and it provides a lot of features such as
    caching, skipping queries, etc. Read how it compares to other tools
    [here](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/comparison).

-   `Eslint` & `Prettier` + `Husky`

# Notes

-   I have some unanswered questions about the designs. Normally, I'd ask before
    implementing it, but in this case I thought it was better to go with my
    assumptions. I've added comments for these situations. See `FIGMA`
